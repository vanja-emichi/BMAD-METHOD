Quick answers to common questions about working on established projects with the BMad Method (BMM).

## Questions

- [Do I have to run document-project first?](#do-i-have-to-run-document-project-first)
- [What if I forget to run document-project?](#what-if-i-forget-to-run-document-project)
- [How does implementation work in established projects?](#how-does-implementation-work-in-established-projects)
- [What if my existing code doesn't follow best practices?](#what-if-my-existing-code-doesnt-follow-best-practices)

### Do I have to run document-project first?

Highly recommended, especially if:

- No existing documentation
- Documentation is outdated
- AI agents need context about existing code

You can skip it if you have comprehensive, up-to-date documentation including `docs/index.md` or will use other tools or techniques to aid in discovery for the agent to build on an existing system.

### What if I forget to run document-project?

Don't worry about it - you can do it at any time. You can even do it during or after a project to help keep docs up to date.

### How does implementation work in established projects?

Run `bmad-quick-dev`, just as you would for new development. It will:

- Auto-detect your existing stack
- Analyze existing code patterns
- Detect conventions and ask for confirmation
- Generate context-rich spec that respects existing code

You can enter directly for a clear change or provide a planned story and its upstream artifacts for larger work.

### What if my existing code doesn't follow best practices?

Quick Dev detects your conventions and asks: "Should I follow these existing conventions?" You decide:

- **Yes** → Maintain consistency with current codebase
- **No** → Establish new standards (document why in spec)

BMM respects your choice — it won't force modernization, but it will offer it.
